# Radionewify
Playlists should be for saving songs, radio should be for discovery.

Spotify's radio algorithm traps you in a narrow musical space where they torture you with the same 50 tracks over and over again. Their curated playlists are just tired old songs reimagined in a different order, and finding a playlist-creator with good taste is a entire journey in itself. Radionewify provides an alternative.

"Never listened to before" means "never any song that is...":

In your playlists (except for the radio(s) generated immediately after you log in — it takes time to extract all the tracks. There's also a limit of 100 000 tracks, to keep my database from crashing)
In your 'liked songs'
One of the 50 most recently played
One of the 50 most listened to long-, medium-, and short-term
Played since you've connected to this app

The recommendations are also not based on your previous listening patterns, and their "max popularity index" is 60.

The reason the app jumps through all of these convoluted hoops is that Spotify doesn't provide the user's entire listening history.

Note: Radionewify works for both free and premium Spotify accounts — but it won't automatically start playing the generated radio for free accounts. (Spotify's API restriction, not my fault!)

Contact: If you want to request a feature or think you've found a bug, feel free to contact me at eliasedgren1@gmail.com.

Privacy policy: All tracks in your playlists, most listened to, and most recently played are collected and saved in a database, which is used to determine what tracks to avoid.

I also save your Spotify account ID and access token, which are needed to add the songs you've played since you connected to the app to the database.

I don't collect name, email, nor will publicly release or sell the data in any way. The database is private and password-locked.
